Freedom | Justice | Humanity

Freedom Fighter Myanmar is a team of ordinary people who would join the fight to bring freedom, justice and humanity to Myanmar and the entire world with peaceful and constructive means.

We believe grassroot movements are the most practical and effective way to bring sustainable changes in Myanmar.

Our tactics are based on the following three principles:
- To abolish the pillars of support for dictatorship,
- To establish a common goal between stakeholders,
- To bring all armed groups under civilian control.
